# GoSnake

## [**Try it out**](http://piwh1000.github.io/GoSnake)

To show you how easy it is to create a multi-user experience for any app, we created a simple snake game using GoInstant.
The objective in Snake is pretty simple--you control a snake on the screen and try to eat as much food as possible without
hitting into the walls. Every time you eat food, your snakes grows in length.

Go wild. Have fun and invite some friends.
